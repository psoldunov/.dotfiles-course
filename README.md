My .dotfiles

I'm learning about dotfiles and how to manage them. This is my first attempt at managing them.

## TODO

- Terminal Preferences
- Changed Shell to ZSH
- Dock Preferences
- Mission Control Preference (don't rearrange spaces)
- Finder Show Path Bar
  Trackpad (Three Finger Drag and Tap to Click)
  .zshrc
- Git (config and SSH)
- Homebrew Install
